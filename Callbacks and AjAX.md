# Event based programming 

1. Used to respond to the event

2. You don't have to create a class 

   

   There are 3 different ways to perform actions when user interacts on any element in our page

   in HTMML `<img onclick = "myClickFunction();"`

   in javaScript  `myImgElement.onClick = function( event ) { }`;

   in javaScript `myImElement.addEvebtListener( "click", myHandlerFunction ())`

### In `js` function are objects
