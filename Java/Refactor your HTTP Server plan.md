### Refactor your HTTP Server plan 

1.  Handle exeptions that should cause the program to exit 

   * include a warring on the screen when that is handle 
   * when we can't connect to the port 
   * when failed to connect to the client (failed to create a client socket)
   * 

   or  log message being printed to the screen

2. From client : 

   * What requests can cause the server to crash? 
     1. wrong file âœ…
     2. 
     3. zz

   * use exceptions to handle this from happening 

     

   * Print a message on client side specifiying the error that happened 
   * print a text on and on your server's console
