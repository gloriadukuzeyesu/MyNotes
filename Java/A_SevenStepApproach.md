# Solving Programming Problems

How to solve progamming problem using a seven step approach

## A Seven step Approach 

 ### 1. Work Example By Hand

* Solve smalll instance by hand 

* unclear problem? ask questions 

* need domain knowldge? Ex: if its files working, educate your self on files. If it is physics, educate your self before moving forward 

  

### 2. Write Down what You Did 

* Write down exact steps. Be Clear and don't leave anything behind . jot down how you solve it in steps by steps fashion 
* Just that instance. Write down the steps for that the instance or the problem you solve not just the more general problem 
* Tricky: do without  thinking 



### 3. Find Pattern

* Alogarithm for any instance. What could be the alogarithm to solve based on the input you given
* Do that by finding patterns 
* Pattersn such as Repetitini , conditions, and values 
* If you struggle with this step : 
  * Try step 1 and 2 again.  ()
  * Try differnt inputs  which can give a new inputs to work with 
  * 

### 4. Check By Hand

* Check your alogarithm before writing your code

* Incorrect pattern? find now 

* Check with different inputs. pick a differnt input. If your alogarithm gives a different number, go back and fix it .

   

### 5. Translate To Code 

* Translate alogarithm to code
  	* Syntax comes into play 
  	* Depending on which language 

### 6. Run Test Cases 

* Run  test cases on code

* Execute program 

* make sure it works. Check answers 

* The more test cases your run, the more you can confidently beleive that your code works however it is not a guarantee

  If you get test failed cases. Time to debug your program 

### 7. Debugg Failed Cases 

* Test failed? Debug 

  * Use Scientific method

    	* is it alogarithm problem?  ----> **Go back to step 3**
    	* is it implematatin problem? ---> **Go back to step 5**

  * Understand problem and fix

    

    

## Seven steps in action: Developing an Alogarithm 

Example : 

Given a shape Find its perimeter ?



####Step1 Work an instance yourself
